The file "5" contains the map data.

Starting at 0x13, the first byte in map data is 0x40. The bit set appears to
indicate that the tile specified by the rest of the byte is used to fill the
tiles in the map until the next specified tile is used.

At 0x14, the byte is 0x17 (23), and since each map row is 20 tiles wide, this
indicates that there should be 1 row and 3 squares of the fill tile.

The bytes at 0x15, 0x16 and 0x17 are tile numbers.

At 0x18, the byte is 0xb2, which specifies a gap between the previous tiles and
the next ones, whether on the same row or on the next row. The top bit
indicates that there is a gap, the next bit is clear, and the next three bits
(two from the top half of the byte and one from the second half) are the number
of tiles in the gap. The remaining three bits are the tile to use - this is
different to the tile number in the fill byte.

  0xb2 = 1011 0010

The initial bytes in the file appear to control screen colours, masking of
tiles and possibly timing. See later for discoveries about this.

At 0x173, the byte 0xc8 (200) is followed by a series of 0x9X bytes and tile
numbers.

Looking at 0x19bb (0xf1) in the devil rock formation, the span of tiles is
14 in length, which means that three bits from the top four are used for the
gap size along with the top bit from the second 4 bits.

At 0x1981 (0xb0), the span is 6 blank tiles.
At 0x1995 (0xa5), the span is 4 of tile 0x19.
At 0x1996 (0xa6), the span is 4 of tile 0x1a.
At 0x199c (0xb4), the span is 6 of tile 0x18.
At 0x19a2 (0x91), the span is 2 of tile 0x3b.
At 0x19a3 (0x9f), the span is 3 of tile 0x1b.
At 0x19a4 (0x5c), the span should be 3 of tile 0x1c.
At 0x19bb (0xf1), the span is 14 O tiles (0x3b).

At 0x19a4, the span is generated by a combination of 0x40 and 0x1c, with the
following byte at 0x19a5 (0x03) indicating the length of the span.

Modifying the 0x9X, 0xaX and 0xbX bytes to compare 0x91, 0xa1 and 0xb1 show
that they all produce the same tile (0x3b), so perhaps there is a table of
tiles for those used in spans which might look like this:

0   0x00 (blank)
1   0x3b (O)
2   0x1d (solid green tile)
3   0x07 (bottom edge)
4   0x18 (red tile)
5   0x19 (red tile with bottom-right green area)
6   0x1a (red tile with bottom-left green area)
7   0x1b (red tile with top-right green area)

The 0x5c span at 0x19a4 is required because there are no more entries in this
table.

This table appears at 0x1971.

At 0x31 (0x90) we expect a span of two containing blank tiles (0), but instead
we see red tiles (0x18) (4 in the table above), so we are looking for a table
that starts with 0x18. This may be the information starting at 0x03 (0x18) and
the reason why certain tiles changed when experimenting with the bytes at the
start of the file. If so, then we would expect the following table to apply to
the first level:

0   0x18 (red tile)
1   0x1d (solid green tile)
2   0x00 (blank)
3   0x2e (blue-green tile with green border)
4   0x38 (red tile with green border and blue building)
5   0x3d (green tile with red border and blue question mark symbol)
6   0x3b (blue tile with green O building)
7   0x02 (top edge)

At 0x12c3 (0x7d), we see question marks, but these do not appear to be the ones
from the first level. This is because the table for the first level is
different to that for the devil rock section.

Looking for the end of the first level, we note that the devil rock section is
preceded by 0x80 (at 0x196d) and three bytes before the table. Looking at the
start of the file, we assume that the map data starts 19 bytes after the level
data and look-up table. In the devil rock section, this would result in data
starting at 0x1980 (0xb0).

In other parts of the file, we see 0x80 bytes: at 0x06e0, 0x0cec, 0x1310,
0x196d, 0x1a04, 0x1c4e, and at 0x1e73, which is the end of the file.

We assume that the bytes preceding the look-up table define the colours of each
level. These are as follows:

0x0000  c4 7b fd  (red, green, blue)
0x06e1  c7 b7 dd  (red, yellow, blue)
0x0ced  cb 3b df  (yellow, blue, green)
0x1311  cd db d1  (white, blue, red)
0x196e  10 7b fd  (red, green, blue)
0x1a05  52 7b f9
0x1c4f  55 9f d5

Each look-up table is also followed by 8 bytes before the level data begins.

0x000b  1a 1e 1f 00 00 00 00 00
0x06ec  0c 14 03 04 05 06 00 00
0x0cf8  11 12 13 15 14 05 1b 1d
0x1318  09 0a 1f 15 1d 1b 1c 1e
0x1979  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0x1a10  0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 03 00 00
0x1c5a  0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 1e 1f 05


The file "2" appears to contain title graphics.
The file "3" appears to contain alien attack formation data.
The file "4" appears to contain sprite data.
