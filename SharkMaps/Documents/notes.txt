In the "CODE" file, some sprite data is found at 0x1d40.

Character movement (jumping) appears to be defined at around 0x4a0.

Map data starts at 0x2be0 and begins describing data almost half way across the
first screen, column-by-column, starting from the top of the screen and ending
at the bottom.

A side effect of setting the byte at 0x2be0 is that the player's bullet sprite
is corrupted.

The game runs in mode 2. Sprite data for level 3 starts at 0x0000 and continues
until 0x400. Sprite data for level 1 starts at 0x1d00 and continues until
0x2100. Sprite data for level 2 starts at 0x2100 and continues until 0x2500.

Note that tile 3 (ground) is used to generate soldiers and must be placed at
the bottom-right of each screen if soldiers are to be generated.
