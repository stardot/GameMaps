Each level map is stored in a file, from "DECKB" to "DECKT" except for the
first level, which is stored at the start of the "Prog2" file.

The levels in separate files are scrambled using a counter that starts with a
value of 1 and increases for each byte read, wrapping around after 255 to 0.
The counter value is combined with each byte from the file using an EOR
operation.

It is difficult to modify the game by creating a new UEF file because the
UEFfile module does not preserve the block headers in data chunks from the
original Icarus.uef file when it writes extracted files to a new UEF file.
The "Game" and "Icarus" files are locked, and the "Game" file appears to rely
on a value stored in the "next address" block header. Applying an EOR 0xa5
operation to the file unscrambles it, but how this is obtained from the header,
and whether the locked bit influences that process is unknown.
