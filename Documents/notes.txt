Level maps are stored in the DAT2 file.

Maps are 64 rows deep by 64 columns wide with 4 bits per tile, with each
column from left to right stored in the file as a sequence of 32 bytes.
So the first set of bytes from 0x100 to 0x120 represent the first column,
0x120 to 0x140 the second, and so on.
The lower 4 bits in each byte represent the upper tile in a pair of tiles; the
upper 4 bits represent the lower tile.

Objects are stored in the part of the file from 0x00 to 0xff. Each object is
described by three bytes containing the column (from left), row (from bottom)
and type of object. The type is interpreted using the following table:

 0: key 0       x, y
 1: scroll      x, y or n, 255
 2: pickaxe
 3: 
 4: 
 5: 
 6: key 2       x, y
 7: key 1       x, y
 8: crucifix    x, y
