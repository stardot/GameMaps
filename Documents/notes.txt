Repton levels appear to be maps of 32 row by 32 columns.

The level data was found by loading the REPTON2 file into memory in MODE 5
and visually inspecting the data. The assumption was that level data follows
the sprite data.

Level data seems to start at 0x2c00.

Setting the lowest 4 bits of the first byte in the first level to 0 results
in a blank cell; setting it to 1 results in a diamond.

Setting the highest 4 bits of the first byte to 0 produces something other
than a blank space.

Setting multiple bytes to 0 results in a group of blank cells followed by
a teleporter-style cell - the type of cell used for teleporters in Repton 2.

Each row of the level appears to be 20 bytes long. This may mean that each
cell is stored in 5 bits.


After some experimentation and reading of levels, this is the mapping between
values and cell types:

     0: space
     1: diamond
     2: boulder
     3: egg
     4: key
     5: earth
     6: earth
     7: earth
     8: safe
     9: brick wall
    10: double (top/bottom) wall
    11: double (left/right) wall
    12: quadruple wall
    13: fancy wall
    14: smooth wall
    15: lower edged smooth wall
    16: upper edged smooth wall
    17: right edged smooth wall
    18: left edged smooth wall
    19: lower right curved smooth wall
    20: lower left curved smooth wall
    21: upper right curved smooth wall
    22: upper left curved smooth wall
    23: map
    24: lower edged brick wall
    25: upper edged brick wall
    26: right edged brick wall
    27: left edged brick wall
    28: lower right curved brick wall
    29: lower left curved brick wall
    30: upper right curved brick wall
    31: upper left curved brick wall

Sprites are stored at 0x2500 in the REPTON2 file and are 8 by 16 pixels. See
the table in the sprites module of the Repton package for the offsets into the
sprite data.


Repton 2 levels appear to start at 0x2e00 and encode the data in rows of 20
bytes (5 bits per cell again).

Because the top row of Screen A is a single wall with two openings at the ends,
it is clear to see that values of 0x1f (31) are solid wall pieces and that
blank cells are 0x00 (0).

The top of Screen B appears to start at 0x2fe0. Screen A is only 24 rows high.
The other screens are 32 rows high.

Sprites appear to start at 0x2340.

Spirits are 4 by 8 pixels.
Other sprites are 12 by 24 pixels.
