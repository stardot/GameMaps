The levels in the SLIPPER file start at 0xf7d. There are 5 levels per file.

Each level consists of 32 by 32 tiles, stored using one byte per tile.
Values 0x00 to 0x0f are ordinary scenery or collectable tiles, tiles 0x26 to
0x2a are moveable objects, and tiles 0x10 to 0x24 are puzzle pieces.

Loading the SLIPPER file at 0x5403 in order to align the graphics to rows on
screen, it appears that the wall sprite starts at 0xabd.

Puzzle pieces are arrays of 4 by 4 blocks, with twelve different colours.
There are 8 bits per block, so each piece is 16 bytes long. Each puzzle is
therefore 21 * 16 bytes long (336 bytes).

The puzzle pieces start at 0x3a5 in each level file.

The pieces are positioned from left to right and from top to bottom when
arranged on screen, so the pieces as extracted from the level data are
placed in the following arrangement in order to reconstruct the complete
puzzle:

  0  1  2  3  4  5  6
  7  8  9  a  b  c  d
  e  f 10 11 12 13 14

Each piece is stored as a sequence of columns from left to right, with each
column containing four elements. So the bytes in a piece need to be arranged
in the following way when creating a sprite:

  0 4 8 c
  1 5 9 d
  2 6 a e
  3 7 b f

The passwords are stored at the start of each level file as 5 strings of 7
bytes in length, with each byte scrambled using the EOR of the offset into the
file, so the first byte is actually unscrambed since (X EOR 0) is X.

There is a collection of 210 non-zero values immediately following the password
data. These are a series of coordinate pairs that can be interpreted either as
offsets into the level data, or as two 5 bit values packed together. Each pair
is stored in little-endian form and combined with 0x0400 using an OR operation,
so we need to mask off the upper 6 bits when we read the values put back the
extra bit when we write them.

Each two bytes containing a coordinate pair correspond to the final location
of a puzzle piece. The pairs are stored according to the location of the piece
within the puzzle, with the first seven coordinate pairs describing the top row
of the puzzle, then the middle row, and the last seven describing the bottom
row.

Five sets of 21 coordinates are given, describing the locations of the puzzle
pieces on each level in ascending order.
