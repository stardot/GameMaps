Repton levels appear to be maps of 32 row by 32 columns.

The level data was found by loading the REPTON2 file into memory in MODE 5
and visually inspecting the data. The assumption was that level data follows
the sprite data.

Level data seems to start at 0x2c00.

Setting the lowest 4 bits of the first byte in the first level to 0 results
in a blank cell; setting it to 1 results in a diamond.

Setting the highest 4 bits of the first byte to 0 produces something other
than a blank space.

Setting multiple bytes to 0 results in a group of blank cells followed by
a teleporter-style cell - the type of cell used for teleporters in Repton 2.

Each row of the level appears to be 20 bytes long. This may mean that each
cell is stored in 5 bits.


After some experimentation and reading of levels, this is the mapping between
values and cell types:

     0: space
     1: diamond
     2: boulder
     3: egg
     4: key
     5: earth
     6: earth
     7: earth
     8: safe
     9: brick wall
    10: double (top/bottom) wall
    11: double (left/right) wall
    12: quadruple wall
    13: fancy wall
    14: smooth wall
    15: lower edged smooth wall
    16: upper edged smooth wall
    17: right edged smooth wall
    18: left edged smooth wall
    19: lower right curved smooth wall
    20: lower left curved smooth wall
    21: upper right curved smooth wall
    22: upper left curved smooth wall
    23: map
    24: lower edged brick wall
    25: upper edged brick wall
    26: right edged brick wall
    27: left edged brick wall
    28: lower right curved brick wall
    29: lower left curved brick wall
    30: upper right curved brick wall
    31: upper left curved brick wall



Sprites are stored at 0x2500 in the REPTON2 file with data at the following
offsets and lengths:
