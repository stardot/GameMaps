Repton levels appear to be maps of 32 row by 32 columns.

The level data was found by loading the REPTON2 file into memory in MODE 5
and visually inspecting the data. The assumption was that level data follows
the sprite data.

Level data seems to start at 0x2c00.

Setting the lowest 4 bits of the first byte in the first level to 0 results
in a blank cell; setting it to 1 results in a diamond.

Setting the highest 4 bits of the first byte to 0 produces something other
than a blank space.

Setting multiple bytes to 0 results in a group of blank cells followed by
a teleporter-style cell - the type of cell used for teleporters in Repton 2.

Each row of the level appears to be 20 bytes long. This may mean that each
cell is stored in 5 bits.
